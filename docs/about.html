          <p>
            Our mission is to provide a safe, dignified home and a structured environment where men
            living with mental health challenges can maintain stability, develop daily living skills,
            and stay connected to their community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that every person deserves respect, privacy, and the opportunity to participate
            in making decisions about their life and care.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Genesis Lodge operates from a historic property on Church Street East, originally built in
          the 18th century and known locally for its distinctive architecture and long-standing
          presence in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, the home has transitioned to a supportive housing setting, while maintaining the warmth and
          character of a family home.
