    <h1>About Genesis Lodge</h1>
    <p>
      Genesis Lodge is a supportive home for fully physically functioning males, age 26 and older,
      who are living with mental health issues and benefit from help with daily living.

      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>
        We start from a simple belief: every person is unique and deserves to feel respected and valued.
        Our staff and volunteers work alongside the people we support, encouraging them to be the experts
        in their own lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on preserving dignity and self-respect. Support is offered in a way that builds confidence
        and independence, rather than taking control away from the individual.
      </p>
      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, Genesis Lodge has built strong relationships with community resources across Brampton.
        We help residents stay connected to family, friends, healthcare providers, and community programs that
        support their mental health and recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create a stable, predictable environment where people feel safe, supported, and part of
        a community—both inside the house and in the wider city.

    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <p>
      The lodge operates in a historic three-storey house on the outskirts of Brampton, originally built
      in the 19th century and later recognized as a heritage property.
    </p>

  <div class="layout">

      <p>
        The home was first owned by the Vodden family. In 1986 it was purchased and adapted to provide care
        for retired individuals. Over time, the need for housing and support for people with mental health
        issues became more visible in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genesis Lodge evolved in response to that need. Today, it offers a safe, family-like environment where
        residents can receive structured support while maintaining as much independence as possible.
